# OpenCV Learning Path 🚀

A structured and progressive OpenCV course covering image processing fundamentals, advanced techniques, and upcoming object detection modules.

This repository is designed as a complete learning roadmap in Computer Vision using Python and OpenCV.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is organized into multiple levels:

- ✅ Fundamentals – Core image processing concepts  
- ✅ Advanced Image Processing – More complex transformations and operations  
- 🔜 Master Level – Optimization, performance tuning, and real-world pipelines  
- 🔜 Object Detection – Face detection, Haar cascades, and modern detection approaches  

The goal is to build a strong foundation in computer vision before moving into detection and real-world applications.
